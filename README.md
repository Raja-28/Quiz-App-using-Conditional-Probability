I've just developed a quiz application that calculates the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of another event using Conditional probability. I learned this concept in my academic subject Ai&Ml and applying it in this project has been an incredible experience.

This project has not only solidified my understanding of conditional probabilities but also shown how classroom learning can translate into practical solutions.

Looking forward to exploring more intersections between AI, ML, and real-world applications!
